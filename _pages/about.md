Hi, this is Sitan's homepage. I am currently a Senior AI/ML Scientist in Forecasting Science team of [Supply Chain Optimization Technology](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) at Amazon, where I lead the team's AI/ML research on deep learning time series models for direct revenue-impacting [supply chain demand forecasting](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/the-history-of-amazons-forecasting-algorithm). I started my career at Bloomberg as a quantitative analyst developing Cross-Asset Derivative Pricing products and also worked for Equity Option Trading desk at Morgan Stanley. I got my Ph.D. from [Applied Math and Statistics Department](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) of Johns Hopkins University.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
