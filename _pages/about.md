Hi, welcome to my homepage. I am currently a Principal AI scientist at [Keystone AI](https://www.keystone.ai/) where I lead a small team building cutting-edge AI-driven prediction and decision science for real-world business operations. Before joining Keystone, I was a Senior AI/ML Scientist in Forecasting Science team of [Supply Chain Optimization Technology](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) at Amazon, where I lead the team's AI research and deployment of large-scale deep learning models for direct revenue-impacting [supply chain demand forecasting](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/the-history-of-amazons-forecasting-algorithm). I started my career at Bloomberg as a quantitative analyst developing Cross-Asset Derivative Pricing products and also worked for Equity Option Trading desk at Morgan Stanley. I got my Ph.D. from [Applied Math and Statistics Department](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) of Johns Hopkins University. 

I am a passionate researcher, builder and practitioner of real-world AI/ML models for problems such as Supply Chain Optimization and Quantitative Trading. My current research interests include
   - Deep Learning architecture innovations for time series forecasting
   - Time series foundation models
   - Multimodal forecaster with LLM and time series
