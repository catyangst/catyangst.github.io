Hi, welcome to my homepage. I am currently a Senior AI/ML Scientist in Forecasting Science team of [Supply Chain Optimization Technology](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) at Amazon, where I lead the team's AI/ML research on deep learning time series models for direct revenue-impacting [supply chain demand forecasting](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/the-history-of-amazons-forecasting-algorithm). I started my career at Bloomberg as a quantitative analyst developing Cross-Asset Derivative Pricing products and also worked for Equity Option Trading desk at Morgan Stanley. I got my Ph.D. from [Applied Math and Statistics Department](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) of Johns Hopkins University.
